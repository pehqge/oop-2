# Object-Oriented Programming II (INE 5404)

This repository contains resources and assignments for the Object-Oriented Programming II course. Advanced OOP topics include design patterns, exception handling, file I/O, and more complex data structures.

## Jupyter Notebooks with Course Summaries

The Jupyter notebooks with summaries created by Professor Guilherme Derenievicz and adapted by Professor Jônata Tyska can be accessed in the [Jupyter notebooks](./jupyter%20notebooks/) folder.

## Assignments Developed Throughout the Course

The following table lists all the exercises completed during the course, in order of their submission date. The group assignments were completed by me, [Augusto Schweitzer](https://github.com/AugustoSchw), [Rodrigo Schwartz](https://github.com/R0drigoSchwartz), and [Tom Hunt](https://github.com/tmphnt).

## The Lost Key - Final Project of the Course

The final project of the course was completed in a group by me, [Augusto Schweitzer](https://github.com/AugustoSchw), [Rodrigo Schwartz](https://github.com/R0drigoSchwartz), and [Tom Hunt](https://github.com/tmphnt). The project consisted of creating an object-oriented game using the concepts learned during the course (such as aggregation, composition, inheritance, polymorphism, clean code, SOLID principle, UML diagram).
